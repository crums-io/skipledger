The earliest known version was published in Samuel Arnold's Juvenile Amusements in 1797 with the lyrics:

    Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,
    Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
    Four-score Men and Four-score more,
    Could not make Humpty Dumpty where he was before.

A manuscript addition to a copy of Mother Goose's Melody published in 1803 has the modern version with a different last line:
"Could not set Humpty Dumpty up again". It was published in 1810 in a version of Gammer Gurton's Garland.
(Note: Original spelling variations left intact.)

    Humpty Dumpty sate on a wall,
    Humpti Dumpti had a great fall;
    Threescore men and threescore more,
    Cannot place Humpty dumpty as he was before.

In 1842, James Orchard Halliwell published a collected version as:[10]

    Humpty Dumpty lay in a beck.
    With all his sinews around his neck;
    Forty Doctors and forty wrights
    Couldn't put Humpty Dumpty to rights!

Evidence of an alternative American version closer to the modern received rhyme quoted above is given by William Carey Richards
in the issue of a children's magazine for 1843, where he comments that he had come across it as a riddle when he was five-years
old and that the answer was "an egg".

    Humpty-dumpty sit upon a wall,
    Humpty-dumpty had a great fall;
    All the king's horses and all the king's men
    Couldn't put humpty-dumpty together again.
